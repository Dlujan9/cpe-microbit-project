# CPE micro:bit Term Project

Term project for students in the CPE 1040 course at MSUD, Fall 2018.

## Assignment

Design and implement some application of the [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) educational computer. It can be a new design of your own or an already existing design from the Web.

### Language requirement

The implementation has to be in [MicroPython](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (the version of Python that works on the micro:bit). 

**Note:** It is perfectly acceptable to take a project implemented in JavaScript/Blocks and rewrite it in MicroPython.

## Submission

### 1. Github

Fork and clone this directory and submit the URL of your fork (remote) on [Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1397722/assignments/10046266?module_item_id=20700270).

### 2. Individual

You can collaborate with one or two team mates on the design, implementation, and testing of the project, but you have to have *your own* separate Github repository and make an *individual* submission on Canvas.

### 3. Due date

**Sun, Dec 2, 2018, by 23:59**

**Note:** You can submit your URL at any time before the deadline on Canvas, but only your latest commit on Github before the deadline will be evaluated.

### 4. Project report

Write the project report in your README using the template provided below. 

**Note:** Projects without reports will receive **0 points** for the whole project.

### 5. Project demo

The project has to be demonstrated by the team in the lab period on **Wed, Nov 28**. Presentation slides are *optional* but will be noted in the evaluation of your submission. If you can't make this date, you can demo at any *earlier* date, but no later dates.

**Note:** The demo is not optional. If a project is not demonstrated, the grade will be at the discretion of the instructor.

## Grading

The project is worth a total of 600 points. Breakdown:

| Criterion | Points |
| --- |:---:|
| Functionality of application | 300 |
| Good use of [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) capabilities | 100 |
| Input and output | 50 |
| Complexity of the application | 50 |
| Quality of demo | 50 |
| Clarity of report | 50 |

# Project Report

Fill out this template in place in the README of your own fork of the assignment repository. Put any supporting materials (diagrams, schematics, pictures, presentation slides, etc) in the [assets](assets) folder. You can reference them from this report. For example, [todo file](assets/todo.md). Use this [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to format the report.

## 1. Project Title

Multiplayer R.P.S.L.S.

## 2. Team

*Who worked on this project/application?*

Daniela Lujan, Katya Torres

## 3. Project Objective

*Describe what you set out to achieve. What [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) capabilities were necessary and/or useful for your implementation.*

At the beginning we set out to achieve a two player rock, paper, scissor, lizard, and spock game but later we decided to make it multiplayer with an embedded score counter and the ability to talk. The [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/guide/features/) capabilities necessary for our implementation were the radio feature, the two programmable buttons, the 25 individually-programmable LEDs, the motion sensor and the pins for external connections.

## 4. Research

*What sources did you consult (Web, instructor, etc)? Don't plagiarize; give credit where it's due!*

Throughout the process of constructing the project my partner and I consulted the instructor, various internet sources, and the [BBC micropython reference manual](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/introduction.html). We consulted the instructor to help us correct some of our code and to ask questions regarding the project itself. We consulted multiple internet sources searching for ideas for the entire project. We found very advanced projects with step by step tutorials such as the [Flappy Bird Game](https://youtu.be/MO-2DiHDZvg) or [an arcade game](https://youtu.be/99Z4KU8yHyc) but we wanted to design a more original idea to get the most experience from the project. Finally, to implement counting, radio, and images into our project we consult the [BBC micropython reference manual](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/introduction.html).   

## 5. Design

*Describe your design briefly and reference any supporting materials in the [assets](assets) forlder.*

## 6. Development

*Keep a list of your development activities here, regardless of their success. Reference any supporting materials or external sources.*

## 7. Testing

*Describe your testing approach. What was successful and what failed?*

## 8. Demo

*Briefly record the results of the in-class demo.*

## 9. Summary

*Summarize your project, from idea to demo. Point out lessons learned. Mention the most important features of the micro:bit that supported your application.*
